# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: June 17, 2018 - Father's Day

**Today's Progress**: I added geoJSON coded location markers for flow stations along Sabino Creek and Tanque Verde to the OSM map I started at the Open Data Day.

**Thoughts** GeoJSON encoding is rather tedious, but it's nice to see the map getting populated. I'm not certain about the lat/long I used for the Bear Creek USFS station (I think it's on the wrong stream) and I'm a bit frustrated hard coding the geoJSON in the JS file, but I'll figure out how to tackle the XSS issues after I get all the pins in the right locations.

### R1D2: June 18, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: I added geoJSON coded location markers for flow stations along Tanque Verde and Rillito River to the OSM map I started at Open Data Day 2018.

**Thoughts** This is the day I gave my notice at WMG to accept a position as a contractor for the Microsoft Foundation. So, a bit of a momentous day. As far as my coding for today went, I am getting concerned that the Google Map (where the lat/lon for the markers was originally determined) is using a different reference system than OSM. The markers seem to be off a bit (sometimes quite a bit).
