# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: June 17, 2018 - Father's Day

**Today's Progress**: I added geoJSON coded location markers for flow stations along Sabino Creek and Tanque Verde to the OSM map I started at the Open Data Day.

**Thoughts** GeoJSON encoding is rather tedious, but it's nice to see the map getting populated. I'm not certain about the lat/long I used for the Bear Creek USFS station (I think it's on the wrong stream) and I'm a bit frustrated hard coding the geoJSON in the JS file, but I'll figure out how to tackle the XSS issues after I get all the pins in the right locations.
